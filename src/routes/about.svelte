                            Teachers, more than any others, have the capacity to change the lives of individuals and, indeed, the future of a nation. <br><br>
                            This belief has driven Malcolm Williams’ career in education, with 18 years as a Head of top schools across the Independent, Public and Cambridge school sectors. <br><br>
                            Malcolm thrives on coaching, developing and growing others, and celebrating the success which follows the pursuit of excellence.  As a teacher and family man, Malcolm enjoys building relationships and engaging with others; he believes that positive relationships are the core of the learning experience and of attaining fulfilment. <br><br>
                            <span class="think">ThinkTeacher’s</span> goal is to ensure that each teacher receives the specific support they may require to be the best they can be as people, and as teachers. As Head of Operations, Malcolm is excited by the opportunity to oversee the range of inputs and support options which <span class="think">ThinkTeacher</span> will be offering its members. <br><br>
                            Malcolm seeks to live life to the full, savour each moment and experience, and get the job done, properly ... with large dollops of fun thrown in for good measure!
