                        It is our experience that many graduates, and others
                        entering the teaching profession are on occasion
                        uncertain about how to get 'into the system', connect
                        with schools, be appointed to a post and/or receive
                        mentorship and support to avoid the 'sink or swim'
                        situation many new teachers find themselves in.
